## Main objective
Provide a novel model-specific, local  XAI solution to enhance the model interpretability of Black-Box models focus on
Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor, and Logistic Regression by developing a novel counterfactual rule generation
mechanism related to the text classification domain.

## Main Research question

How to get a counterfactual rule generation-based explanation for the SVM, k-NN, Random Forest and Logistic Regression in text classification?

## Individual research question

## Thilini Anjalika

How to get a counterfactual rule generation-based explanation for the Random Forest classifier, when it becomes black box in text classification?

## Sashini Devindi

How to get a counterfactual rule generation-based explanation for the Support Vector Machine classifier, when it handle non-linear separable data in text classification?

## Srinidee

How to get a counterfactual rule generation-based explanation for the Logistic Regression classifier, when it handles non-linear relationship or greater data complexity in text classification?

## Lakshani N.V.M.

How to get a counterfactual rule generation-based explanation for the k-NN classifier, when it handle  Curse of Dimensionality problem in text classification?
